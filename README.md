- 👋 Hi, I’m @GIJackson
- 👀 I’m interested in video games, fantasy novels, and physical training!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to further my education through the mysteries of coding.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on many projects with like minded inviduals. 
- 📫 Reach me at my "<a href="mailto:gijcancer@gmail.com">e-mail!</a>" I'm still not used to "<a href="https://app.slack.com/client/T028GLGJNT1/browse-files/user_profile/U03DZDWCH0D">slack</a>" or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillermo-jackson-40846723a">linkedin</a>, but it's something to improve on.
